MissingOutputException in line 31 of /home/fieldima/biof501-pipeline/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
Viral_Sequence_Data/WNV_Genomes.fasta_nuc.fas
Viral_Sequence_Data/WNV_Genomes.fasta_protein.fas
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 4 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 4
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
