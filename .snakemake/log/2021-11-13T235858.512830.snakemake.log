Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 89 of /home/fieldima/biof501-pipeline/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
MSA/WNV_Genomes_aligned.FEL.json
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 1 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
